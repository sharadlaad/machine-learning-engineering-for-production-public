More concretely, you will deploy a computer vision model trained to detect common objects in pictures. Deploying a model is one of the last steps in a prototypical machine learning lifecycle. However, we thought it would be exciting to get you to deploy a model right away. This lab uses a pretrained model called [`YOLOV3`](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/). This model is very convenient for two reasons: it runs really fast, and for object detection it yields accurate results.\n",

        "#### Client-Server model\n",
        "\n",
        "When talking about **deploying**, what is usually meant is to put all of the software required for predicting in a `server`. By doing this, a `client` can interact with the model by sending `requests` to the server. \n",
        "\n",
        "This client-server interaction is out of the scope of this notebook but there are a lot of resources on the internet that you can use to understand it better.\n",
        "\n",
        "The important thing you need to focus on, is that the Machine Learning model lives in a server waiting for clients to submit prediction requests. The client should provide the required information that the model needs in order to make a prediction. Keep in mind that it is common to batch many predictions in a single request. The server will use the information provided to return predictions to the client, who can then use them at their leisure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's get started by creating an instance of the `FastAPI` class:\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",

Both technologies are closely interconnected and you don't need to understand the implementation details. Knowing that uvicorn handles the serving is sufficient for the purpose of this lab.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Endpoints\n",
        "\n",
        "You can host multiple Machine Learning models on the same server. For this to work, you can assign a different `endpoint` to each model so you always know what model is being used. An endpoint is represented by a pattern in the `URL`. For example, if you have a website called `myawesomemodel.com` you could have three different models in the following endpoints:\n",

        "\n",
        "Each model would do what the name pattern suggests.\n",
        "\n",
        "In fastAPI you define an endpoint by creating a function that will handle all of the logic for that endpoint and [decorating](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/) it with a function that contains information on the HTTP method allowed (more on this next) and the pattern in the URL that it will use.\n",

        "The client and the server communicate with each other through a protocol called `HTTP`. The key concept here is that this communication between client and server uses some verbs to denote common actions. Two very common verbs are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `GET` -> Retrieves information from the server.\n",
        "- `POST` -> Provides information to the server, which it uses to respond.\n",
        "\n",
        "If your client does a `GET request` to an endpoint of a server you will get some information from this endpoint without the need to provide additional information. In the case of a `POST request` you are explicitly telling the server that you will provide some information for it that must be processed in some way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interactions with Machine Learning models living on endpoints are usually done via a `POST request` since you need to provide the information that is required to compute a prediction.\n",

        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "With fastAPI you can create web servers to host your models very easily. Additionally, this platform is extremely fast and it **has a built-in client that can be used to interact with the server**. To use it you will need to visit the \"/docs\" endpoint, for this case this means to visit http://localhost:8000/docs. Isn't that convenient?\n",
